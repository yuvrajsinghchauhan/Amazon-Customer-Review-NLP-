# Amazon-Customer-Review-NLP-
The Internet has revolutionized the way we buy products. In the retail e-commerce world of online marketplace, where experiencing products are not feasible. Also, in today’s retail marketing world, there are so many new products are emerging every day. Therefore, customers need to rely largely on product reviews to make up their minds for better decision making on purchase. However, searching and comparing text reviews can be frustrating for users. Hence we need better numerical ratings system based on the reviews which will make customers purchase decision with ease.

During their decision making process, consumers want to find useful reviews as quickly as possible using rating system. Therefore, models able to predict the user rating from the text review are critically important. Getting an overall sense of a textual review could in turn improve consumer experience. Also, it can help businesses to increase sales, and improve the product by understanding customer’s needs.

Sentiment Analysis, also known as Opinion Mining, is one of the common research areas which performs Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks for the purpose to extract subjective information by analyzing text data written by users. In the case of sentiment analysis of review data, the main goal is to identify the user’s subjectivity and classify the statements into different groups of sentiments.

The amazon review dataset for electronics products were considered. The reviews given by the user to different products as well as reviews about user’s experience with the product(s) were also considered.

In this program, we aim to perform a sentiment analysis of product reviews written by online users from Amazon. This problem will be viewed as a multi-classification process and we seek to predict the sentiment scale of the user reviews based on machine learning classifiers.
